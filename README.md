# Hacker1991
A fun retro hacker game written in Python, in spirit of the hacker BBS doors of the 1990s


# Summary
Hacker 1991 is a short preview of my new game, which will probably get a sparse amount of my attention.
I hope that it will someday be completed. The goal is to create a fun unix-like operating system that expands in
functionality as the game progresses. I suspect this can be done with many built-in functions that progressively are 
released as user level increases. There is also the possibility of plugins (chunks of python interpreted by the code module),
that could possibly be additional BBSes, programs, and features. The real world security aspect of this idea needs to be evaluated.

# Game Premise
You are a hacker wannabe script kitty from 1991. It is a whole new world of networked computers with terrifying levels of
security (ie: lack there of). With few laws on the books in 1991 to restrict the player, and player's complete disregard of
existing laws anyway, it is the wild west and hayday of hacking. Although, also implemented is the modern day version of cryptocurrency,
the ByteCoin. This is the fictional currency of the early 90's hacker.

You will start out with a basic computer, slow modem, and old viruses found on a floppy disk from your older brother. You will scan phone numbers
using a wardialer to discover BBSes and systems to hack into. As you progress, you will learn new skills, obtain better
viruses, better software, potentially compete with other players (TBD), and more. 

Want to cheat? learn how to hack into the included SQLite3 database, modify run time variables in the hidden REPL, create
your own plugins, and hack the Python code -- assuming your lack of morals and interest in spoilers are what fancies you.

# OS Support
Currently, Hacker 1991 is designed to function on OSX, but will probably work on any other platform. The only problem is sound
support. I am working on making this compatible with more platforms, such as Linux and Windows.

# Completed
* Intro
* Status
* Somewhat unix shell
* ByteCoin miner

# To Do (near term)
* Save user progress
* Actually use the database
* BBSes
* Wardialer
